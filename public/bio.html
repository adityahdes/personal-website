        <h1><a href="..">Aditya Desai</a> / Bio</h1><br/>

        <p>I'm a Undergraduate Computer Science and Mathematics Double Major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. My undergraduate work in Math focuses primarily on Discrete and Applied Mathematics. As for my primary major, the fields of AI and Quantum Computing are of the most interest to me.</p>
        <p>I've interned at CCC Information Services in Chicago, IL; and Rose-Hulman Ventures in Terre Haute, IN. I have experience developing in Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and SQL. I also have some experience working with AWS and other industry tools.</p>
        <p>Outside of Computer Science and Mathematics, I have completed a Minor in Japanese Language, and I am hoping to take the JLPT in the near future.</p>
